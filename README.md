# Credits
This site was built using Gatsby, a React-based static site generator. The site design is a Gatsby theme called [Intro](https://github.com/wkocjan/gatsby-theme-intro) that was built by []Wojciech Kocjan](https://github.com/wkocjan)

# Getting Started
For info on how to run the app, I have provided the text from the theme's README in the wiki so you can view at your leisure. At some point in the future I may bundle the important info into this file for quick reference.
