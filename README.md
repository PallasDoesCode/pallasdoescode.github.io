This site was made possible thanks to the **[Jekyll Now static site generator](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)**. The page was developed using **[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)** and was designed using **[Bootstrap 3](http://www.getbootstrap.com)**.

## Publishing a blog post

1. Go to the `/_posts/` folder and create a new file by hitting the “+” icon in /_posts/.
2. Change the file name to include today’s date and the title of your post. Jekyll requires posts to be named `year-month-day-title.md`.
3. When creating your post, update the title at the top of the Markdown file. Those variables at the top of the blog post are called front matter. They specify which layout to use and the title of the blog post. Additional front-matter variables exist, such as permalink, tags and category.

**Note:** Don't forget to format the file name correctly and to include the front-matter block otherwise the file will not get processed by Jekyll.
