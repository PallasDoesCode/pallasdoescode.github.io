Welcome to my blog, my name is Tyler Hughes. I'll be blogging on my various projects, whether they be personal or open source. The content you see here will mostly be about Microsoft related technologies such as C#, ASP.NET, PowerShell, Microsoft Azure, and NuGet; however you may also see small amounts of content on JavaScript, Java, and Ruby.

This site is very much a work in progress. The design you see at this time may not be what is here a month from now. My goal is to eventually turn this site into a portfolio/blog. I hope to have the site designed and implemented within a couple of weeks so stay tuned.
