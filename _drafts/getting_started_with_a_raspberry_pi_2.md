Last year, [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) and [Saron Yitbarek](http://bloggytoons.com/) started a new campaign called [MarchIsForMakers](http://marchisformakers.com/). According to Saron, "MarchIsForMakers is a month long celebration of everything Making." It is a great way to showcase Makers and their passion for things hardware and manufacturing. In honor of March is for Makers I'm going to be writing a few posts about the Raspberry Pi. As luck would have it I just bought a Raspberry Pi a couple weeks ago. This post will be talking about my first experience with a Raspberry Pi and how I got around the firt roadblock I had with it.

For those of you who aren't already familiar with the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) it's a small but affordable $35 computer. It's about the size of a credit card. It comes with 4 USB ports and one HDMI port so it can be plugged into a computer monitor or TV and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It's possible to do just about everything that you'd expect from a computer. However, it does not come with Windows and is often used along side Linux. It's a great small computer for anyone wanting to learn more about programming and Making.
